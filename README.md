# airicketbot
I am building an AI-powered cricket coaching app called CricCoach AI. The application should allow users to interact with a chatbot for coaching, and enable admin users to upload, manage, and analyze cricket player data (batting, bowling, fielding stats). I need the frontend in React and the backend in Python (FastAPI preferred).
